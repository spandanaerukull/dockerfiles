# ONBUILD is trigger instruction it will not execute when we build this image, it will execute when we use this image as base image for other dockerfiles
# so when we use this image as base image for other dockerfiles it will copy index.html to nginx html location
# so we can create multiple images using this image as base image and each image can have different html pages
# so this is used to create base image for our application images
